# TODO Output Template

This template shows the expected output format for `/todo-task-planning` command results.

## Model Selection

When the host agent supports model selection for this task, prefer a low-cost, fast model from those available in that environment, provided it can perform the task reliably. Use the host's documented model identifiers and selection mechanism; do not assume a particular provider or invent model names or parameters. Respect explicit user and project model settings. If model selection is unavailable or no suitable alternative is known, keep the current model. Using this template within a larger planning task does not require switching models or launching a sub-agent.

## Overview

The output template demonstrates:
- **Execution Summary**: Research performance, technical analysis, and duplicate checks
- **Task Classification**: Tasks organized by feasibility (✅ Ready, ⏳ Pending, 🔍 Research, 🚧 Blocked)
- **Complete Checklist Format**: All items in markdown checklist format with status indicators
- **Research Rationale**: File references (📁) and analysis basis (📊) for each task
- **Git Workflow Integration**: Branch creation and PR tasks when `--branch` or `--pr` options are used

## Template Structure

### Option-Based Variations

**Differences by Option**:
- **`--branch` only**: Phase 0 (Branch Creation) is added, Phase 4 (PR and Merge) is NOT added
- **`--pr`**: Both Phase 0 (Branch Creation) and Phase 4 (PR and Merge) are added
- **No options**: Neither Phase 0 nor Phase 4 is added

### Full Example Template

**Note**: The following is an example when `--branch` option is specified. In practice, include only tasks directly necessary to achieve the objective.

```markdown
## 📊 Thorough Execution Summary
- [ ] **Research Performance**: 18 files and 5 directories researched and completed
- [ ] **Technical Analysis**: Confirmed Nuxt.js 3.x + MySQL configuration
- [ ] New tasks: 6 (✅3, ⏳1, 🔍1, 🚧1)
- [ ] **Research Rationale**: Detailed analysis of 8 files, confirmation of 3 technical constraints
- [ ] **Duplicate Check**: Avoided duplication of 4 past researches, 2 questions, 1 task
- [ ] **docs/memory saved**: analysis/2025-01-15-auth-flow.md, questions/auth-questions.md
- [x] **Updated file**: $ARGUMENTS file (directly updated and verified)

## 📋 Task List (Complete Checklist Format)

### Phase 0: ブランチ作成 ✅ (when --branch option is specified)

- [ ] ✅ **ブランチを作成**
  - コマンド: `git checkout -b feature/actionlog-notification`
  - 📋 このブランチで全ての変更をコミット
  - 推定時間: 1分

### 🎯 Ready Tasks (✅ Immediately Executable)
- [ ] ✅ API authentication system implementation 📁`src/api/auth/` 📊Authentication flow confirmed
  - [ ] Implement login endpoint - Create `auth/login.ts`
    - 💡 Use Express.js POST handler pattern from `auth/register.ts`
    - 💡 Validate credentials with bcrypt, generate JWT token
    - 💡 Return { token, user } on success, 401 on failure
  - [ ] Implement token verification middleware - Create `middleware/auth.ts`
    - 💡 Follow middleware pattern in `middleware/logger.ts`
    - 💡 Use jsonwebtoken.verify() to validate token from Authorization header
    - 💡 Attach decoded user to req.user for downstream handlers
  - [ ] Add session management - Extend `utils/session.ts`
    - 💡 Add createSession() and destroySession() methods
    - 💡 Use Redis client pattern from `utils/cache.ts`
- [ ] ✅ Database schema update 📁`prisma/schema.prisma` 📊MySQL support
  - [ ] Update Prisma schema - Add new model definitions
    - 💡 Follow existing User model pattern (id, createdAt, updatedAt fields)
    - 💡 Add Session model with userId foreign key relation
  - [ ] Generate migration - Execute `npx prisma migrate dev`
    - 💡 Run after schema changes, provide descriptive migration name
- [🔄] ✅ User profile page implementation 📁`pages/user/profile.vue` - In progress
  - [x] Basic profile display ✓ `components/UserProfile.vue` completed
  - [ ] Add profile edit functionality - Create `components/UserProfileEdit.vue`
    - 💡 Copy form structure from `components/UserProfile.vue`
    - 💡 Add v-model bindings for editable fields (name, email, bio)
    - 💡 Call PATCH /api/user/:id with updated data on submit
- [ ] ✅ Commit after implementation complete
  - 💡 Execute micro-commit to commit changes by context
  - 💡 Estimated time: 2-3 minutes

### ⏳ Pending Tasks (Waiting for Dependencies)
- [ ] ⏳ Frontend UI integration 📁`components/` - After API completion (waiting for `auth/login.ts` completion)
  - [ ] Login form component - Create `components/LoginForm.vue`
  - [ ] API client setup - Configure `composables/useApi.ts`

### 🔍 Research Tasks (Research Required)
- [ ] 🔍 Third-party API integration 📊To research: API documentation and authentication method
  - [ ] Review API documentation - Check endpoints and rate limits
  - [ ] Determine authentication approach - OAuth vs API key

### 🚧 Blocked Tasks (Blocked)
- [ ] 🚧 Payment integration 📊Blocking factor: Payment provider not decided, Stripe vs PayPal
  - [ ] Payment provider selection - Compare pricing and features
  - [ ] Payment flow design - Determine checkout process

## ❓ Questions Requiring Confirmation (Checklist Format with Research Rationale)
- [ ] [Specification] What authentication method should be used? 📊Current status: Session-based auth implemented, token-based TBD
- [ ] [UI] What is the design system color palette? 📊Current status: Basic Tailwind config, custom theme not set
- [ ] [UX] What are the detailed specifications of the user flow? 📊Current status: Only basic authentication flow implemented

## 🎯 Next Actions (Checklist Format)
- [ ] Collect answers to blocker questions, confirm authentication approach
- [ ] Start implementation from ✅Ready tasks, progress step-by-step
- [ ] Confirm and adjust dependencies
```
