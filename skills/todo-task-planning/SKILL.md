**Command arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

## Usage

```
/todo-task-planning <file_path> [--pr] [--branch <name>]
```

### Arguments
- `file_path` (required): Path to the file for task planning execution
- `--pr` (optional): Create a pull request after task completion. When specified, tasks will include branch creation (auto-generated if --branch not specified), commits, and PR creation
- `--branch <name>` (optional): Branch name to create and use for task execution. Creates the specified branch and commits all changes to it. Can be used independently or with --pr option

## Command Overview

This command reads the specified file ($ARGUMENTS) and performs comprehensive task planning.
It can be executed repeatedly on the same file and also manages, confirms, and updates questions.

**Important**: This command is designed to be executed repeatedly.
Do not question the fact that the same command will be executed multiple times; analyze and plan with a fresh perspective each time.

**Important**: The file specified in $ARGUMENTS will be the TODO management file.
Avoid including specifications and research results in this file as much as possible; use docs/memory to store research results.
Also, do not excessively abbreviate research results; retain them.
Check each time whether you have researched something in the past.
Do not neglect checking to avoid duplicating research results and tasks.

## Branch and PR Options Usage

### Option Behavior

**`--branch [branch_name]` option:**
- **Adds a branch creation task at the beginning of the task list**
- If `branch_name` is provided: Uses the specified branch name
- If `branch_name` is omitted: Auto-generates branch name following Git naming conventions
- All commits during task execution will be made to this branch
- Can be used independently without `--pr`
- Useful when you want to work on a feature branch but don't need a PR yet

**Branch name auto-generation rules:**
- Analyzes TODO file content to determine branch type and purpose
- Follows Git naming conventions: `{type}/{descriptive-name}`
- Types: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `docs/`
- Format: lowercase, hyphen-separated, English
- Example: `feature/actionlog-email-notification`

**`--pr` option:**
- Includes all `--branch` functionality (branch creation and commits)
- **Adds a pull request creation task at the end of the task list**
- If `--branch` is not specified, a branch name will be auto-generated
- The PR will include all changes made during task execution
- If PR template instructions exist in CLAUDE.md or similar files, those templates will be used

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Example 1: Create branch with auto-generated name (no PR)
/todo-task-planning TODO.md --branch
# → Generates branch name like: feature/actionlog-notification

# Example 2: Create branch with specific name (no PR)
/todo-task-planning docs/todos/feature-x.md --branch feature/user-auth

# Example 3: Create PR with auto-generated branch name
/todo-task-planning docs/todos/feature-x.md --pr
# → Auto-generates branch name and creates PR

# Example 4: Create PR with specific branch name
/todo-task-planning docs/todos/feature-x.md --pr --branch feature/user-auth

# Example 5: Basic task planning (no branch, no PR)
/todo-task-planning docs/todos/feature-x.md
```

### Implementation Guidance

When these options are specified, the task planning should include:

**For `--branch` option:**
- **Branch Name Determination:**
  - If branch name is provided: Use as-is (validate against naming conventions)
  - If branch name is omitted: Auto-generate following this logic:
    1. Read TODO file title and content
    2. Determine branch type based on task nature:
       - `feature/` - New functionality implementation
       - `bugfix/` - Bug fixes, issue resolution
       - `refactor/` - Code restructuring without behavior change
       - `chore/` - Development environment, dependencies, tooling
       - `docs/` - Documentation updates
    3. Extract key feature/issue name from TODO (2-4 words max)
    4. Convert to lowercase, hyphen-separated English
    5. Format: `{type}/{descriptive-name}`
    6. Example: "ActionLog Email Notification" → `feature/actionlog-email-notification`
- Task to create the determined/generated branch at the beginning
- All modification tasks should indicate they will be committed to this branch
- No PR-related tasks

**For `--pr` option:**
- Task to create a branch (using specified name or auto-generated)
- All modification tasks with commit instructions
- Final task to create a pull request with proper description
- PR description should summarize all changes made

## Core Guidelines

Phase 0 reads and applies `/key-guidelines` at the start of every execution

## [CRITICAL]Important Implementation Requirements

**MANDATORY**: This command MUST update the $ARGUMENTS file (the file specified as a parameter)
- **Main Claude executor** (not a subagent) uses Edit or Write tool to update files
- After calling subagents in Phase 1, update the $ARGUMENTS file with those results in Phase 5
- Add new task planning results in a structured format while preserving existing content
- After file update is complete, confirm, verify, and report the updated content
- **CRITICAL**: The $ARGUMENTS file update is NOT optional - it must be executed in every run

## Processing Flow

### [CRITICAL]Phase Dependency and Execution Rules

**[PROHIBITED]PROHIBITED PHASE SHORTCUTS - MUST FOLLOW SEQUENTIAL FLOW ⛔**

The following phase shortcuts are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**:
- [NG]**Phase 1 → Phase 5 direct transition** (MOST COMMON VIOLATION)
- [NG]**Phase 1 → Phase 6 direct transition**
- [NG]**Phase 2 → Phase 5 direct transition** (skipping Phase 3-4)
- [NG]**Phase 3 → Phase 5 direct transition** (skipping Phase 4)

**Why These Shortcuts Are Dangerous:**
- **Data Loss**: Phase 2 existing task analysis will be ignored
- **No Integration**: New tasks won't integrate with existing TODO.md content
- **Missing Validation**: User questions won't be asked, leading to incorrect assumptions
- **File Creation Failures**: docs/memory files won't be created at proper time

| **Phase 2** | [OK]MANDATORY | 🚫 NO | Phase 1 | exploration_results |

| **Phase 9** | [OK]MANDATORY | 🚫 NO | Phase 8 | Verification report |

**Phase 8 Conditions:**
- [OK]**Questions exist**: MUST execute AskUserQuestion tool and wait for responses
- [OK]**No questions**: MUST proceed to Phase 9 and document reason in Phase 10

### [WARNING]Critical Phase Transition Rules

**Rule 1: Sequential Execution Only**
- Each phase MUST complete before the next phase begins
- No parallel execution of phases
- No skipping of phases
- Each Phase is independent and must be executed in a separate turn/message

**Rule 2: Subagent Phases (2-3) Must Execute Sequentially**
```
[NG]WRONG FLOW (Parallel Execution):
Phase 2 (Explore) + Phase 3 (Plan) → Called in same message
                    ↓
            PARALLEL EXECUTION
                    ↓
    Result: Phase 3 starts before Phase 2 completes, missing dependencies

[OK]CORRECT FLOW (Sequential Execution):
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 (wait) → Phase 3 (wait) → Phase 4 → ...
   ↓         ↓         ↓                ↓                ↓
  Key-    TODO     Explore          Plan            Verify
 Guide   Reading   (output)       (needs P2)      (check all)
```

**Rule 3: Never Skip to Phase 8 (File Update)**
- Phase 8 requires outputs from ALL previous phases
- Skipping Phase 5-7 causes data loss and missing integration
- Phase 5 (File Analysis) results are mandatory for Phase 6
- Phase 7 (Questions) is the entrance gate to Phase 8

**Rule 4: Phase 7 is a Mandatory Checkpoint**
- Even if no questions exist, Phase 7 MUST be executed to document this fact
- Phase 8 entrance gate verifies Phase 7 completion

## Variable Scope and Persistence

**IMPORTANT**: Variables set in Phase 1 persist throughout all subsequent phases (Phase 2-9).

**Phase 1 Variables Used in Later Phases**:
- `HAS_PR_OPTION`, `HAS_BRANCH_OPTION`, `BRANCH_NAME`, `IS_AUTO_GENERATED`
  - Set in: Phase 1 Step 2 (argument parsing)
  - Used in: Phase 8 (conditional task insertion)
  - Scope: Available throughout entire skill execution

**Variable Lifecycle**:
```
Phase 1 → Set variables
    ↓
Phase 8 → Use variables for conditional logic
```
